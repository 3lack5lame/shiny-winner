GraceChMS — Frontend Prototype

This folder contains a minimal single-page frontend prototype built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to run

- Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser. No server required for static prototype.

What it includes

- Dashboard, Members, Attendance, and Giving views.
- Local persistence via `localStorage` to simulate a backend.
- CSV export/import (basic), donation simulation, and check-in simulation.

Next steps

- Hook forms to a real backend (API) with authentication.
- Improve accessibility and localization.
- Add unit tests and CI, and optionally a build step.
